            "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century.\n",

            "1. Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere and is composed of different wavelengths (colors) of light.\n",
            "2. When sunlight interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere, such as nitrogen and oxygen, the shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more than the longer wavelengths (like red and orange).\n",
            "3. This scattering effect is more pronounced for smaller particles, like those found in the atmosphere.\n",
            "4. As a result, the blue light is dispersed in all directions and reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky.\n",
            "\n",
            "In contrast, the longer wavelengths (red and orange) are not scattered as much and continue to travel in a straight line, reaching our eyes mainly from the direction of the sun.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is why the sky appears blue during the daytime, especially in the direction of the sun. However, when the sun is low on the horizon or behind clouds, the light has to travel through more of the atmosphere, which scatters the shorter wavelengths even more, making the sky appear more red or orange.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, in short, the sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering, which disperses the shorter wavelengths of sunlight in all directions, reaching our eyes from the entire sky.\n"
